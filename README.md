# Welcome to "Later" EN/BG

Wlcome to "Later", a pet-project with microservicies, kafka, PostgeSQL and a little bit of compler magic)))

This is my pet-project, an app called "Later" (an Pastebin app). In this app users can store a url or simple text. At
curent stage it consits of five microservicies: 


1. discovery-microsevice - the main microservice, checks if other microservicies are online
2. api-gateway-micreservice - all redirects all requests from users the corresponding microservice
3. notification-microservice - recieves a message about new user or new item from 'items-micreservice' or 'users-microservice' to send notification via email
4. items-micreservice - process the requests connected with 'item'(post of user)
5. users-microservice - process the requests connected with users

# How to start on your device

Make shure you installed Kafka on your device(kafka should run in kraft mode)

(additional) you can install PostgreSQL on your device

### 1)Clone the repository on your device

### 2)Setup Database(PostgeSQL / H2)
You can find all necessary SQL scripts below
```
CREATE TABLE users (
user_id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(20),
last_name VARCHAR (20),
email VARCHAR(20),
user_state VARCHAR(20),
user_password VARCHAR(20),
user_login VARCHAR(20)
);
```
```
CREATE TABLE items (
item_id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
url VARCHAR(2048),
user_id BIGINT,
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);
```
### 3)Send a request
Now you can send a request to Later App using Postman(you can use prepared postman requests from folder 'postman' шт the main directory)
